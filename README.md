This is a fork of the Troupe Programming Language with the focus of making compiled Troupe programs run in the browser and expanding Troupe to use browser APIs with IFC enforcement.

Please visit the official Troupe repo for installation and more info about the language.


To start Troupe-web, go to the rt folder and type:
`npm start`


Start a local server that compiles Troupe, by given a file to compile as argument:
`node apiServer.js pathToFile`

In Troupe-web type `compile` to get a compiled version of the file and execute it. One can edit the file and type `compile` again to get the newest compiled version.
